	   <p>I am a decade older than many of the students in this class, but I'm not the oldest one.<br>
	      I currently live in Oslo and I am going to be a computer engineer.<br>
	   </p>

	    <p> <strong>Here are some more <em>fun facts</em> about me:</strong></p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>I was born in 1984
	            <ul><li>Holy moly, I'll be 30 this year!</li></ul>
	        </li>
	        <li>I grew up in Ivory Coast</li>
	        <li>I am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid"> TCK </a> and an 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_kid"> MK</a></li>
	        <li>Before I started studying computer engineering, I was a teacher and a freelance musician</li>
	        <li>I once did backup vocals for 
				<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ez3W2f-Ebc0/TxrHDAmOe4I/AAAAAAAAA4Y/iNxi63_qFp8/s1600/LIONEL+RICHIE.jpg"> Lionel Richie </a></li>
	    </ul>
	    <br><strong>I also have som interests: </strong>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Reading</li>
	            <ol>						<!-- Look at my list within a list! --> 
	                <li>Sci-Fi</li>
                    <li>Adventure</li>	                    
					<li>Crime and thrillers</li>
	                <li>Anything about how the mind works or how humans learn.</li>
	            </ol>
   			<li>Singing and playing guitar</li>
            <li>Drinking Coffee</li>
			<li>Doing sports and working out</li>
			<li>Coding html</li>
        </ul>
			
	    <p> <h3> Net privacy and freedom of speech </h3> <br>
			I think net privacy is a term most people do not understand. I've certainly learned a lot about the current lack of privacy <br> 
			and how much information some of the largest companies on the planet have about me. Apple, Google and Facebook probably know <br>
			more about me than anyone of my parents or close friends, and if I was a dissident in an authoritarian regime, that might be <br>
			a huge problem. <br> George Orwell was closer to the mark than he had any reason to suspect. Technology is awesome but also <br>
			carries with it some very real problems. Problems that most people <!-- Yes, I generalizeâ€¦ --> don't know about or ignore. <br>
			I think we should think more about these issues, and I am looking forward to discussing them in class.
